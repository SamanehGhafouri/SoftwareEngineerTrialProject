# Software Engineer Trial Project
This project used input data from Random User Generator (https://randomuser.me), and includes 2 folders: Front-End and Back-End
### Front-End
A sing page web application in `Angular CLI` that displays informational graphics about the randomly generated users as a chart.
* Hosted at `vercel`: https://statistics-app.vercel.app/home

### Back-End
A REST API endpoint using `Flask` that takes random user JSON, and a file format as input, and returns a file containing the statistics.
* Hosted at `heroku`: https://statistics-sam.herokuapp.com
